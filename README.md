## prometheus Overview

prometheus are autonomous AI agents that act just like real hackers - they run your code dynamically, find vulnerabilities, and validate them through actual proof-of-concepts. Built for developers and security teams who need fast, accurate security testing without the overhead of manual pentesting or the false positives of static analysis tools.

**Key Capabilities:**

- **Full hacker toolkit** out of the box
- **Teams of agents** that collaborate and scale
- **Real validation** with PoCs, not false positives
- **Developer‑first** CLI with actionable reports
- **Auto‑fix & reporting** to accelerate remediation

## Use Cases

- **Application Security Testing** - Detect and validate critical vulnerabilities in your applications
- **Rapid Penetration Testing** - Get penetration tests done in hours, not weeks, with compliance reports
- **Bug Bounty Automation** - Automate bug bounty research and generate PoCs for faster reporting
- **CI/CD Integration** - Run tests in CI/CD to block vulnerabilities before reaching production

## 🚀 Quick Start

**Prerequisites:**
- Docker (running)
- An LLM API key from any supported LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.)

### Installation & First Scan

```bash
# Install prometheus
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StefanIsMe/prometheus/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

# Configure your AI provider
export prometheus_LLM="openai/gpt-5.4"
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Run your first security assessment
prometheus --target ./app-directory
```

> [!NOTE]
> First run automatically pulls the sandbox Docker image. Results are saved to `prometheus_runs/<run-name>`

## ✨ Features

### Agentic Security Tools

prometheus agents come equipped with a comprehensive security testing toolkit:

- **Full HTTP Proxy** - Full request/response manipulation and analysis
- **Browser Automation** - Multi-tab browser for testing of XSS, CSRF, auth flows
- **Terminal Environments** - Interactive shells for command execution and testing
- **Python Runtime** - Custom exploit development and validation
- **Reconnaissance** - Automated OSINT and attack surface mapping
- **Code Analysis** - Static and dynamic analysis capabilities
- **Knowledge Management** - Structured findings and attack documentation

### Comprehensive Vulnerability Detection

prometheus can identify and validate a wide range of security vulnerabilities:

- **Access Control** - IDOR, privilege escalation, auth bypass
- **Injection Attacks** - SQL, NoSQL, command injection
- **Server-Side** - SSRF, XXE, deserialization flaws
- **Client-Side** - XSS, prototype pollution, DOM vulnerabilities
- **Business Logic** - Race conditions, workflow manipulation
- **Authentication** - JWT vulnerabilities, session management
- **Infrastructure** - Misconfigurations, exposed services

### Graph of Agents

Advanced multi-agent orchestration for comprehensive security testing:

- **Distributed Workflows** - Specialized agents for different attacks and assets
- **Scalable Testing** - Parallel execution for fast comprehensive coverage
- **Dynamic Coordination** - Agents collaborate and share discoveries

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Scan a local codebase
prometheus --target ./app-directory

# Security review of a GitHub repository
prometheus --target https://github.com/org/repo

# Black-box web application assessment
prometheus --target https://your-app.com
```

### Advanced Testing Scenarios

```bash
# Grey-box authenticated testing
prometheus --target https://your-app.com --instruction "Perform authenticated testing using credentials: user:pass"

# Multi-target testing (source code + deployed app)
prometheus -t https://github.com/org/app -t https://your-app.com

# White-box source-aware scan (local repository)
prometheus --target ./app-directory

# Focused testing with custom instructions
prometheus --target api.your-app.com --instruction "Focus on business logic flaws and IDOR vulnerabilities"

# Provide detailed instructions through file (e.g., rules of engagement, scope, exclusions)
prometheus --target api.your-app.com --instruction-file ./instruction.md

# Force PR diff-scope against a specific base branch
prometheus -n --target ./ --scope-mode diff --diff-base origin/main
```

### Headless Mode

Run prometheus programmatically without interactive UI using the `-n/--non-interactive` flag—perfect for servers and automated jobs. The CLI prints real-time vulnerability findings, and the final report before exiting. Exits with non-zero code when vulnerabilities are found.

```bash
prometheus -n --target https://your-app.com
```

### CI/CD (GitHub Actions)

prometheus can be added to your pipeline to run a security test on pull requests with a lightweight GitHub Actions workflow:

```yaml
name: prometheus-penetration-test

on:
  pull_request:

jobs:
  security-scan:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v6
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Install prometheus
        run: curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/StefanIsMe/prometheus/main/scripts/install.sh | bash

      - name: Run prometheus
        env:
          prometheus_LLM: ${{ secrets.prometheus_LLM }}
          LLM_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.LLM_API_KEY }}

        run: prometheus -n -t ./
```

> [!TIP]
> In CI pull request runs, prometheus automatically scopes quick reviews to changed files.
> If diff-scope cannot resolve, ensure checkout uses full history (`fetch-depth: 0`) or pass
> `--diff-base` explicitly.

### Configuration

```bash
export prometheus_LLM="openai/gpt-5.4"
export LLM_API_KEY="your-api-key"

# Optional
export LLM_API_BASE="your-api-base-url"  # if using a local model, e.g. Ollama, LMStudio
export PERPLEXITY_API_KEY="your-api-key"  # for search capabilities
export prometheus_REASONING_EFFORT="high"  # control thinking effort (default: high, quick scan: medium)
```

> [!NOTE]
> prometheus automatically saves your configuration to `~/.prometheus/cli-config.json`, so you don't have to re-enter it on every run.

**Recommended models for best results:**

- [OpenAI GPT-5.4](https://openai.com/api/) — `openai/gpt-5.4`
- [Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6](https://claude.com/platform/api) — `anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6`
- [Google Gemini 3 Pro Preview](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai) — `vertex_ai/gemini-3-pro-preview`

See the in-repo `docs/llm-providers/` directory for all supported providers including Vertex AI, Bedrock, Azure, and local models.
