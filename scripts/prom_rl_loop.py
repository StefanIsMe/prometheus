"""
Prometheus RL Loop — headless driver invoked by the /loop-driven Claude session.

Each invocation performs ONE action (SCAN, REVIEW, FIX, TEST) and writes
a handoff note at /tmp/prom-rl-handoff.md so the next /loop turn has full
context without re-reading the world.

Action picker: ε-greedy over the running reward average, with a 3-strike
rule that auto-switches target when the same target produces 0 findings
three times in a row.

This driver actually LAUNCHES prometheus (SCAN) and actually PARSES the
resulting run dir (REVIEW). FIX and TEST run deterministic code edits
against the prometheus source tree, with pytest as the gate.

Hard caps (enforced inside this driver so even a runaway Claude cannot
exceed them):
  - At most 1 prometheus subprocess spawned per call
  - At most 5 minutes wall-clock per call (longer for SCAN; see below)
  - At most 1 commits per call (FIX only)
  - Always writes a handoff file before exiting

Subcommands:
  step        pick + execute one action, write handoff
  pick        just pick (no execution); used when Claude wants to think first
  handoff     print the current handoff path
  reset       clear the policies table (forgets reward history)
  back-log    print the fix backlog (deduplicated, in order)
  demote      force a target into the cold bucket (used by 3-strike)
  targets     print target streak summary

Exit codes:
  0  - action completed
  1  - stop condition hit (no progress, disk low, watchdog dead)
  2  - invalid usage
