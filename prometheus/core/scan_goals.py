"""
Discovery Goal system for prometheus.

Tracks exploitation goals derived from vulnerability findings. Each goal
represents an active pursuit to validate and build a PoC for a discovered
finding. The ScanGoalManager persists goals to disk so they survive across
scan cycles.

Modeled on the Hermes goal system (hermes_cli/goals.py).
